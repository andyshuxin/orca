Introduction
============
Orca generates HTMLs from markdown files, with very few additional functions.
I wrote it for my personal website [shux.in](http://shux.in).

Unsupported Features
====================
Orca does _not_ support the following features:
* Comments,
* Tags,
* Social media integration,
* Plugins,
* and many others.

Currently Supported Features
============================
Orca does support the following features:
* Generating HTMLs,
* Building a index.html from the list of articles,
* Several additional formatting options, and
* GitHub syncronization.

Features to be Implemented
==========================
I may add the following features to the site generator:
* Automated backup (in addition to GitHub),
* Customized title on the front page.

Why the name?
=============
I like black and white. Among the few cases of black and white animals, I find orcas (killer whales) to be the most graceful. I want my personal website to like orcas.
